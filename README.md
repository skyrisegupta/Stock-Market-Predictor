  <h1>Stock Market Prediction using LSTM</h1>
  <p>
    This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. It fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the <code>yfinance</code> library, preprocesses the data, and splits it into training and testing sets. The machine learning model is built using the Keras library with LSTM layers followed by dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance. Finally, the model's predictions are compared with the actual stock prices to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.
